      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am an Engineer with almost 15 years of professional and international experience, mainly in the IT sector. I was involved in the different phases of SDLC from development to production, and worked in both conventional and Agile environments (certified Scrum Master). In the last 6 years, I had the chance to focus more on the following areas: quality assurance / control, data analysis, business intelligence, and performance improvement. I am a team player, an analytical thinker, detail-oriented, and an effective problem-solver with a strong ability to work under pressure, and in multicultural teams to achieve ambitious objectives and exceed clients’ expectations.</p>
